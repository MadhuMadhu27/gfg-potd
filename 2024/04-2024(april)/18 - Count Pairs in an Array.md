## 18. Count Pairs in an Array

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/two-repeated-elements-1587115621/1)

### My Approach
To solve this simple traverse the array, mark elements as negative to indicate their presence.
- If an element is already negative, it means it's a repeated element. Add it to the output vector.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoRepeated(int arr[], int n) {
        vector<int> out;
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 2; ++i) {
            if (arr[abs(arr[i])] > 0)
                arr[abs(arr[i])] = -arr[abs(arr[i])];
            else
                out.push_back(abs(arr[i]));
        }
        return out;
    }
};
```
