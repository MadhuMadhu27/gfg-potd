## 11. Gray to Binary equivalent
The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/gray-to-binary-equivalent-1587115620/1)

### My Approach
To convert a Gray code to binary, we can use bitwise XOR operations. The process involves iterating through each bit of the Gray code, and at each step, XOR-ing it with the previously processed bit. This results in the binary representation of the given Gray code.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity** : `O(log n)`, where n is the input number.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity** : O(1).

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int grayToBinary(int n)
    {
        int ans = 0;
        while(n > 0)
        {
            ans = ans ^ n;
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
